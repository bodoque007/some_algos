A simple rotating cube made with Python, Numpy and Pygame.
You can use the up/down keys to increase/decrease the cube's rotation speed, respectively.
Made it in an hour or so, as I wanted to understand the math behind a 3D cube's rotation in a 2D space (your screen) and no better way to understand things than to create them yourself!
