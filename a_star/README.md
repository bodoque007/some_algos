Have Pygame installed and python 3.10 (at least).
First, select the starting and ending point in the screen by left-clicking on any spot.
Secondly, you'll be able to draw the obstacles of the maze by Ã±eft-clicking and/or holding down.
Lastly, if you made a mistake making the maze and want to delete an obstacle, simply right-click the obstacle you wish to remove.
Once you're done with the maze you created, press escape and see the algorithm trying to find a path to it.
As for now, no path reconstruction algorithm is implemented. The window simply closes whenever it reached the ending cell or realised the maze is impossible to solve, printing out to the terminal which of those possibilities happened.

This was simply made after finishing the conway script, as I saw I could take advantage of already having the grid implemented.
